## Iron Door Security - Website Optimization Plan

**1. Responsive Design Testing:**
   - Test the website on various screen sizes (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones - both portrait and landscape modes).
   - Use browser developer tools to emulate different devices and screen resolutions.
   - Ensure all content is readable and interactive elements are easily clickable/tappable on all devices.
   - Verify that navigation menus adapt correctly to smaller screens (e.g., using a hamburger menu).

**2. Image Optimization:**
   - Compress all images to reduce file sizes without significant quality loss.
   - Use appropriate image formats (e.g., WebP for modern browsers, JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency).
   - Implement responsive images using `<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute to serve different image sizes based on viewport.

**3. Code Minification:**
   - Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to reduce their size.
   - Use tools like Terser for JavaScript and cssnano for CSS.

**4. Browser Caching:**
   - Leverage browser caching by setting appropriate cache-control headers for static assets.
   - This will allow returning visitors to load the site faster.

**5. Lazy Loading:**
   - Implement lazy loading for images and other non-critical resources that are below the fold.
   - This will improve initial page load time.

**6. Performance Testing:**
   - Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and WebPageTest to analyze website performance.
   - Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.

**7. Accessibility Check:**
   - Re-verify that the website meets WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
   - Ensure all interactive elements are accessible.

**8. Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
   - Test the website on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.

**9. SEO Best Practices:**
   - Ensure all pages have appropriate meta titles and descriptions.
   - Check for broken links.
   - Ensure a logical heading structure (H1, H2, H3).
   - Submit a sitemap to search engines.

**10. Final Review and Deployment:**
    - Conduct a final review of all pages and features.
    - Prepare for deployment to a live server.
